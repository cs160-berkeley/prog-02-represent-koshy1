# PROG 02: Represent!

This app allows users to look up information on representatives of their area (or someone else's) based on a zipcode. Users can see their representatives' latest tweets, what committees they are on, and what recent bills they have sponsored, in addition to general information like the representative's party affiliation, title/posiont, and term end date. It also has a watch companion app with an extra feature of shaking the watch to take the user to the representatives of a random area.
